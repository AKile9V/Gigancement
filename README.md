# Gigancement

### [World of Warcraft addon](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gigancement) (retail only)
Lightweight enhancements and modifications to the Blizzard default UI. <br/>
All of them are pretty simple implemented, so they aren't memory heavy and most of them are using 0 or close to 0 CPU time. <br/>
With that in mind, please don't expect anything huge in additional, those things are just my personal tweaks to enhance the Blizzard default UI experience.

## Setup options from default addon interface
Some of them require reloading, others are applied right away!
